          As the U.S. begins reconciling with Cuba, Seattle Times reporter Ángel González found the island country is regaining some capitalist bustle thanks to reforms slowly doled out by its socialist government. Some restaurant owners and other small entrepreneurs are prospering, but most workers still struggle on an average salary of $24 a month. The big payoff, many hope, will come with the influx of U.S. tourists.

          Internet connections are scarce and pricey in Cuba, but they make life less isolated.  For some savvy entrepreneurs who’ve found a way around the government’s strict controls, renting Wi-Fi connections is a way to make a living.

          Cuba’s renowned health-care system, which flourishes despite the country’s poverty, still has lessons to teach the world, experts say. Hundreds of U.S. students have attended medical school tuition-free in Cuba, including a UW grad who plans on returning home to practice in underserved communities in Kitsap County.
