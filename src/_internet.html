  <p>CAMAGÜEY, Cuba —
  <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the shadow of Our Lady of Solitude, a landmark temple built centuries ago by a long-gone aristocracy of cattle barons and sugar planters, dozens of <em>camagüeyanos</em> peek into their smartphones and tablets as they jostle at dusk for precious bandwidth at the local Wi-Fi spot.
  <p>Many gather in family groups as they video-chat with relatives abroad; others, seeking a bit of privacy, use headphones with mouthpieces. In this island bastion of communism, surfing the internet is a collective experience.
  <p>It’s not a cheap pastime. ETECSA, the state communications monopoly, sells prepaid cards that provide one hour of access for $2, or about one-tenth of the average monthly wage here. The cards can be hard to find, scooped up by resellers who peddle them in plazas at a 50 percent premium.

The cards are expensive for Cubans, costing two Cuban Convertible Pesos, equivalent to a $2 value, per hour of access. That is approximately 10 percent of the average Cuban monthly salary.</p>

  <p>But, as often is the case in Cuba, savvy people find ways around the rules. For less than a dollar, one can piggyback onto someone else’s public Wi-Fi hookup for an hour. It’s illegal, but the authorities don’t seem to care that much.
  <p>For a historically cosmopolitan people splintered by waves of exile and migration, the public Wi-Fi spots are an essential tether.

Right: A family at a public park with a Wi-Fi hotspot in Camagüey passes around a phone to have a video chat with a baby relative in another country.</p>

  <p>“This is the only thing that makes us happy,” says Caridad Morell, 64, sitting with her husband on a bench along Calle República, Camagüey’s main commercial thoroughfare, video-chatting with her two sons who live in Kentucky.
  <p>The hardships of getting online in Cuba, and the resourcefulness Cubans muster to do it, reflect the contradictions of an oddball country undergoing a transition to globalization that’s inevitable — but far slower than many here want.
  <p>The government still wants to control access to the internet. But authorities also realize its potential to foster the economic growth Cuba’s citizens badly need — and their unquenched appetite for information.
  <p>Less than 0.1 percent of Cubans have a fixed broadband subscription, compared with 10.5 percent of Costa Ricans and 31 percent of U.S. residents, according to the World Bank.
  <p>Still, 30 percent of Cubans use the internet. That’s well below the Latin American average, but it shows the popularity of the 153 or so Wi-Fi hot spots the Cuban government has set up as it tries to keep a lid on soaring demand.

  <p>No other place epitomizes the Cuban government’s ambiguous relationship with the internet better than the Museo Orgánico de Romerillo, a museum in a poor neighborhood in the western outskirts of Havana.
  <p>Started by Alexis Leiva Machado, a hugely famous Cuban artist who goes by the name Kcho (pronounced kah-sho), the museum hosted <em>comandante máximo</em> Fidel Castro himself at its 2014 opening,
  <p>That’s a sign of the institution’s deep alignment with the values of the Cuban revolution.
  <p>The museum is endowed with a broadband internet connection, which the artist first shared with the neighborhood via computer terminals for which people take a number and line up from 7 a.m. to midnight. Each person has a 30-minute window to surf the web.
  <p>Kcho also added a free Wi-Fi hot spot, a feature that draws people here from as far as central Havana.
  <p>Free Wi-Fi, though, comes with a dose of revolutionary fervor. Security guards greet visitors with the politically correct title <em>compañero</em> (comrade). The Wi-Fi password is “<em>abajo el bloqueo</em>” — “down with the blockade,” which is what the Cuban government calls the U.S. trade embargo.
  <p>The original password was “here no one surrenders.”
  <p>Whatever its vows of resistance, Kcho’s museum has turned out to be the beachhead of the U.S. internet juggernaut Google in Cuba.
  <p>In March 2016, as President Obama visited the island, the Mountain View, Calif., search giant set up a hall here with about 20 Chromebook computers and virtual reality headsets connected to ETECSA.
  <p>A Cuban flag and a big portrait of Fidel Castro wearing a baseball cap hang above a sign that reads “Google Cultural institute,” while Cuban internauts check Facebook or chat with their loved ones overseas.
  <p>Manuel Bridón, a 23-year-old soldier, is talking with his grandmother, who lives in Rochester, N.Y. He comes from San Miguel del Padrón, a suburb on the other side of Havana. It’s a one-hour journey, “sweaty and hot,” but it’s worth not having to pay outrageous amounts, he says.

  <p>Still, a Silicon Valley denizen would have a fit: Access here is painfully slow — and not always reliable. “The computers have to be disconnected when there are thunderstorms,” Bridón says.
  <p>In a blog post, Google said that in Cuba it’s “exploring additional possibilities around increasing and improving internet access, but they’re at early stages.” (The company declined to comment further.)
  <p>The people who run the museum see internet access as a tool in service of a greater goal, that of spreading culture and revolutionary ideals. “Free internet is the ideal hook,” says museum guide Quirenia Montejo.

  <p>The Cuban state is also aware of the value of the internet as a productivity tool. Cuba decidedly “intends to connect with the world,” reads a December 2014 editorial in Granma, the official Communist Party newspaper, published a few days before the U.S. and Cuba announced the re-establishment of relations. “The decision has been made not only to drink from that huge fountain of knowledge that is the ‘information highway,’ but also to place in it the best of our culture, education, knowledge and humanism, which represent the founding nucleus of the Cuban revolution and of the thought of its leaders.”
  <p>At the same time, it’s clear the government doesn’t envisage a freewheeling online universe. “Cuba advances toward the safe digitalization of society, without haste but without pause,” the editorial said. It added that the internet must be a space of learning and development that can “guarantee the invulnerability of the Revolution, the defense of the culture and the sustainable socialism our people are building.”

  <p>Meanwhile, Cubans, many of whom have smartphones and computers either bought here or sent by family abroad, find ways to satiate their appetite for information while living without a “cloud.”
  <p>One way is through an offline content-sharing system dubbed <em>el paquete</em>. It’s a USB drive-load of Latin American soap operas, downloaded websites, and television series such as “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Game of Thrones.” Couriers deliver it at home or customers pick it up at “copy centers,” stores that sell bootleg music and movies in addition to photocopy services,
  <p><em>El paquete</em> comes with ads and coupons for local businesses. And it enables local startups to gather an audience. It’s a vehicle for Revolico, a local version of Craigslist. Its founder, Hiram Centelles, says the site is periodically blocked by the government.
  <p>There’s no politics, and not much in the way of news. People in Cuba’s fledgling internet industry say that lets the government turn a blind eye. It’s still illegal, though.
  <p>“Most people request telenovelas,” says the owner of a “copy center” in Camagüey, who didn’t want his name disclosed. An interested user brings a USB drive and requests specific shows.
  <p>Buyers can monitor the copying process through a big computer monitor. The cost: 15 pesos, slightly more than half a U.S. dollar.
  <p>In Havana, there’s a new <em>paquete</em> available every day, according to the copy center owner. But in Camagüey, it’s a weekly deal.
  <p>The dearth of internet access also has let an alternative ecosystem of apps flourish. People exchange photos, music and files using Zapya, a file-transfer app that creates a hot spot for other devices via Bluetooth. Instead of Google Hangouts or Skype, many use Imo, a messaging and video-chatting app.
  <p>Connectify, which turns a computer into a hot spot, is what powers the cottage industry of black market Wi-Fi providers mooching off the public Wi-Fi spots.

  <p class="caption">Anywhere there is shade and places to sit, Wi-Fi entrepreneurs will set up a hotspot, like this one in La Rampa in Havana.</p>
  
  <p>One of these hustlers, who wants his name withheld, charges the equivalent of $1 for one hour of connection in La Rampa, Havana’s most-happening avenue, an area with big hotels, government buildings and Coppelia, a famous ice-cream parlor.
  <p>He says he left his job as a bartender to do this for a couple of hours a day. With eight to 10 people connecting per hour, it’s not bad money.
  “People make do with what they have,” the 22-year-old says.
