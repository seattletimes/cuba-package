    <p>The internet may be slow, and the path to a Silicon Valley-style bonanza is dubious, but that doesn’t mean Cuba lacks its share of tech entrepreneurs willing to give it a try.
    <p>A few have achieved a milestone that eludes many a U.S. startup: black ink.
    <p>“After three months we recouped our initial investment,” says Alfonso Alí, the hip, bearded mathematician who co-founded AlaMesaCuba, a 5-year-old startup that charges restaurants in Cuba’s booming culinary scene to be included in an online directory. “We are already living off of this.”
    <p>AlaMesa rents office space at a five-story government building in the Havana neighborhood of Playa. The large, empty space has only a couple of desks, but it comes with a glorious view of the Florida Straits. And a rare privilege in Cuba: an internet connection.
    <p>It’s not cheap: Alí says the 512-kilobit-per-second connection costs about $300 a month. But it’s better than heading out to the public access Wi-Fi park in La Rampa, a bustling avenue in central Havana, which is what he and his co-founders did before getting the office.
    <p>They also share the space (and bills) with Fonoma, the brainchild of Cuba-born, Spain-based Hiram Centelles. It’s a company that lets Cubans overseas recharge the cellphone and internet accounts of family members and friends back home.
    <p>Centelles is also the founder of Revolico, Cuba’s version of Craigslist, a site that was blocked for years by the government (Cuban news site 14ymedio.com reported that the blockade was quietly lifted in August).
    <p>Fonoma is much less controversial. After all, it does something the state is very interested in — injecting hard cash into the Cuban economy.

    <p>Companies like Centelles’ live in a sort of limbo: It wasn’t until this year that the Cuban government announced small and medium private businesses would be made legal. But things are changing fast, so for Centelles a perch here was worth the effort.



    <p>“We wanted to have a foot in the ground to figure out what’s happening in Cuba,” Centelles said in a phone interview from Spain. “Things that were impossible five years ago are now possible,” Centelles says.
    <p>Internet entrepreneurs also face the daunting technological challenge that their Cuban audience doesn’t have access to the web all the time. AlaMesa walked around that obstacle by making its entire database downloadable; it’s also distributed through physical channels such as el paquete, a USB drive.
    <p>So far more than 15,000 people have downloaded AlaMesa’s mobile app, Alí says. It’s a sign that there are more than just a few Cubans with cash to burn at a pricey, privately owned restaurant.
