  <div class="sidebar-hed">How Cubans live on $24 a month: low prices, gifts from abroad</div>

  <div class="columns">

    <p>In a country where the average monthly salary is $24 and a pound of ground beef costs $2, how can people survive, much less have about the same life expectancy as Americans?
    <p>A large majority of Cubans own their homes. Health care and education are technically free, although resource-challenged. Other prices are heavily subsidized too: Going to a movie costs about 25 U.S. cents. And Cubans get about a third of their monthly food needs for less than $2 through a ration card system instituted in 1962.
    <p>It’s not a generous allotment. Per person, it’s five eggs per month, a pound of chicken, a few pounds of rice and other items, although the very young and the elderly get better rations.
    <p>That means people need to secure food elsewhere. But where do they get the money?
    <p>Those who work in the private sector are OK, according to Carmelo Mesa-Lago, a prominent scholar of the Cuban economy and University of Pittsburgh professor.
    <p>Those who have family abroad are also in luck. Relatives overseas send money, pay directly for luxuries such as cellphones and bring consumer goods on their trips home.

    <p>Florida International University economics professor Jorge Salazar-Carrillo estimates that émigrés’ largesse amounts to $6.6 billion a year, when combining cash with gifts in kind. That’s equivalent to about $600 for every Cuban.
    <p>Mesa-Lago, the University of Pittsburgh scholar, says that at least half the population receives remittances. But that leaves the other half out, creating fault lines that stretch not only along economic, but racial lines, too. Because a majority of exiles are white, and so are their family members in the island, Afro-Cubans are more likely to be left out of the loop, Mesa-Lago says.
