    <p>The Cuban government blames a big part of its economic troubles on a decades-long U.S. embargo on trade and tourism, which it says has cost the island $121 billion. Despite the Obama administration’s overtures, the embargo stands and only Congress can lift it.
    <p>But experts say it’s more complicated. Carmelo Mesa-Lago, an economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a veteran observer of the Cuban economy, says the embargo’s impact is not as serious as it once was: Cuba trades with about 100 countries, and there are some limited purchases of food and medicine from the U.S. After Obama eased the sanctions, some U.S. companies, such as Starwood Hotels and Sheraton, are investing in the island.
    <p>Mesa-Lago, who has publicly opposed the embargo since the 1960s, says the biggest problem it poses for Cuba is making international banking transactions, and therefore foreign investment, more difficult. But the Cuban government is also slow, he says, in closing deals with foreigners. Out of more than 400 proposals the government has received in the past two years, only a dozen have been approved, Mesa-Lago said.

    <p>On the other hand, Gregory Biniowsky, a Havana-based Canadian lawyer who advises foreign companies, says the impact of the embargo is “massive.” It makes everything much more expensive, and the legal complications are more than many European and Canadian investors want to deal with.



    <p>The biggest consequence of the embargo, Biniowsky says, is the fortress mentality it encourages among Cuba’s leadership. “It creates a mindset that is rigid, that is defensive, and slows down the process of reform,” he says.
