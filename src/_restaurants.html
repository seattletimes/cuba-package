Paladars are privately-owned restaurants, as opposed to state-owned - they are generally higher quality, and in cities, more expensive. </div>

<p>An explosion in the number of restaurants epitomizes the surge of Cuba’s private sector, which remains tightly tied to tourism.
<p>But the hurdles these restaurateurs face also underscore how hard it is to undertake a capitalist revolution in Cuba.
<p>The biggest challenge is finding supplies, restaurateurs say. There’s no network of wholesalers (although in July the government opened its first wholesale store catering to businesses).
<p>So restaurants buy items at retail prices at the local bodega, or they strike under-the-table deals with farmers and state employees at food depots.
<p>Some go so far as to get rare ingredients from the closest Costco Wholesale — in Miami — through well-established networks of travelers who charge by the pound.
<p>“There’s not a pickle to be had in Havana,” said the owner of a private restaurant focusing on Eastern European cuisine.
<p>Capital is also scarce, in many cases supplied by family members abroad. So is knowledge of the grittier aspects of commerce.
<p>“They have this private business, and they run it without access to inputs, to finance, without really knowing how markets work, how do you close a sale, how do you do accounting,” said Carlos Parra, a business professor at Florida International University (FIU). “They have to come up with these ideas themselves.”
<p>Parra helped design a curriculum for InCubando, a course run by FIU and Miami nonprofit initiative StartUp Cuba to teach Cuban entrepreneurs the ropes of capitalism. The first batch of entrepreneurs attended the program last summer.
<p>“I was doing everything by instinct,” says Misleidys González, an InCubando alum who owns a flower shop in the city of Holguín. “My business now will work much better.”
