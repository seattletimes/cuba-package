<div class="sidebar-hed">Slow pace of reform hints at behind-the-scenes struggle</div>
<p>One thing that puzzles experts is why Cuba’s reform process is so sluggish.
<p>Raúl Castro has said the country is moving ahead “without haste, but without pause” toward sustainable socialism.
<p>But in an April speech to the latest gathering of Cuba’s powerful Communist Party, he acknowledged things were not moving as fast as they could, with only 21 percent of approved reforms put in practice.
<p>The leader blamed “the baggage of an obsolete mentality,” while at the same time denouncing those who saw “in capitalism’s restoration the solution to our problems.”
<p>Some interpret the comments as a hint of an ideological battle going on behind the scenes. Cuba’s No. 2, José Ramón Machado Ventura, is seen as a hard-liner, embodying Fidel Castro’s aversion to free markets.
<p>“To me it’s completely impossible to understand what’s going on,” says Carmelo Mesa-Lago, a University of Pittsburgh economics professor who has closely watched Cuba for six decades. “They have a fundamental problem, but they don’t hurry.”
<p>Mesa-Lago estimates that Cuba doesn’t need a major political upheaval to allow its highly educated population to be more productive and lessen the country’s dependence on outsiders.
<p>If the country enacted the same agricultural reforms that in China and Vietnam let small producers decide what to produce, for how much to sell it and to whom, “in four years Cuba would be self-sufficient in food,” Mesa-Lago says.
<p>Then again, the paths the country follows have eluded most soothsayers. “Cuba is unpredictable,” Mesa-Lago says.
