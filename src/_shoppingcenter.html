  <div class="columns">
    <p>In the shadow of the Habana Libre, a one-time Hilton where Fidel Castro set up temporary quarters after his triumphant march into Havana, there’s a small, open-air shopping center that wouldn’t look out of place in a tony suburb of Mexico City or Bogotá.
    <p>It has several restaurants, a furniture store, a spinning salon, even a playground with inflatables for children. At a small coffee shop where many of the clients are Cubans, I ask the waitress whether the business is private. A customer, an employee at a state travel agency, barges in on the conversation.
    <p>“I asked the same thing. I couldn’t believe it. Now this looks like any other part of the world,” she says.




    <p>There’s also a copy shop, owned by 72-year old José Antonio Velásquez Gómez, a retired economist. He first came to Havana from his native Guantánamo with Castro’s rebels, which he joined as a teenager. He says the shopping center is owned by a state firm that leases out the space to businesses such as his store, which opened in February.


    <p>What little he saw of life under capitalism before the revolution, he says, “was terrible.” But he endorses the changes that have allowed the blossoming of small businesses and even cooperatives spun off from the state.



    <p>“Complex bureaucracies cannot manage these types of businesses,” Velásquez says. He is confident about the future.

    <p>“One would like (reform) to move faster, but it’s on the good path,” he says. The important thing, he concludes, is maintaining Cuba’s independence so that “nobody rules us.”
    <p>“Everything else can be accepted,” he said.
