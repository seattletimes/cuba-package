    <p>Earlier this year, the U.S. and Cuba struck a deal that allows each country to run up to 110 daily flights between both nations. Alaska Airlines is one of the airlines approved by the U.S. government to fly, from Los Angeles into Havana.
    <p>The first flight, operated by JetBlue between South Florida and the Cuban city of Santa Clara, took place Aug. 31, carrying U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx.
    <p>Vinay Bhaskara, a senior business analyst with Airways, a trade publication, says the number of outbound available seats from the U.S. will jump from 150,000 to more than 1 million annually as the flights ramp up.
    <p>John Kavulich, head of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, says the influx of passengers could potentially overwhelm Cuba’s rundown infrastructure.

    <p>“They can’t process three U.S.-inbound flights a day, let alone what’s going to potentially be two, three, four an hour, bigger planes, and more demanding passengers,” says Kavulich.

    <p>The Cuban state will receive a huge sum of cash from passenger fees that it could reinvest in its airports, says Bhaskara. More difficult, he says, is making sure there are enough hotel rooms to receive all these Americans.

    <p>Cuba counts on luring millions of U.S. tourists every year, if long-standing U.S. prohibitions on travel are lifted, to prop up its ailing economy. Miguel Fraga, a Cuban diplomat visiting Seattle last spring, admitted at a talk that Cuba doesn’t have the infrastructure, but the need is a good opportunity for business investment.
    <p>“It’s going to be better than the Bay of Pigs invasion,” Fraga said at the time.
