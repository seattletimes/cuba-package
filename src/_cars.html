    <p>The most shocking thing about cars in Cuba is not how old they are, but how expensive, a sign of the distortions created by the country’s nether-zone between socialism and capitalism.
    <p>Not many cars are imported by this island nation, making new vehicles scarce. Further enhancing their value is that a car represents a foothold in the tourism industry. Driving tourists around means access to hard currency — and to a life of relative privilege.
    <p>That means a 2012 Kia Rio, a compact car with 44,000 miles on it, last July was being sold on Revolico.com, Cuba’s version of Craigslist, for $63,800. The same car in Seattle, according to Kelly Blue Book, would be worth $8,191.
    <p>Old clunkers from Cuba’s capitalist, pre-1959 era are a relative bargain in comparison. A ’51 Dodge — fitted with an Isuzu engine, a Hyundai gear box and steering from a Russian Lada — was offered for about $12,600 on the same site. That represents 52 years of earnings on a typical salary here.

    <p>There’s also no such thing as an AutoZone. Parts are rare and expensive, most often having come in a suitcase from Miami. A faulty component can trigger a frantic round of phone calls to a driver’s network. Or one can simply go to Revolico, where a set of brake pads for a Daewoo Tico sold for $77. The same item on eBay retailed for $14.86.
